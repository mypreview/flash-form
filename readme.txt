Build a form to be limitless, in a flash &#9889;

== Description ==
Remember you used to waste your time trying to come up with a solution to have a simple form or survey on your website? It takes a support ticket, an engineer, and a few hours to just “replace a text input with a dropdown menu instead!” Huh?

“Flash Form” offers an in-house form builder that’s fully integrated with the WordPress component library and design system. Everybody on your team can create, edit, and publish forms and surveys on your website regardless of their technical background.

“Flash Form” takes care of the repetitive and annoying stuff—keeping track of values/errors, orchestrating validation, and handling submission—so you don’t have to. This means you spend less time navigating back and forth from one admin screen to another and more time focusing on your data collection requirements.

If you know WordPress and know a bit about forms, you already know “Flash Form”! There is no fancy post-type registration or admin settings screen under the hood, just plain React-based WordPress Gutenberg block. “Flash Form” makes form creation a breeze by leveraging and staying within the core WordPress editor components and away from magic.

== Installation ==
= Minimum Requirements =

* PHP version 7.4 or greater.
* MySQL version 5.6 or greater or MariaDB version 10.0 or greater.
* WordPress version 5.5 or greater.

= Automatic installation =

Automatic installation is the easiest option — WordPress will handle the file transfer, and you won’t need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install of the plugin, log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu, and click “Add New.”

In the search field type “Flash Form”, then click “Search Plugins.” Once you’ve found the plugin, you can view details about it such as the point release, rating, and description. Click “Install Now,” and WordPress will take it from there.

= Manual installation =

The manual installation method requires downloading the plugin and uploading it to your webserver via your favorite FTP application. The WordPress codex contains [instructions on how to do this here](https://wordpress.org/support/article/managing-plugins/#manual-plugin-installation "Manual plugin installation").

= Updating =

Automatic updates should work smoothly, but we still recommend you back up your site.
